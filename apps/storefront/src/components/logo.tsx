/**
 * Annaadhya brand lockup — official brand assets.
 *
 * Left:  the animated honey-drop video (800x800, ~8s seamless loop) — muted,
 *        autoplaying, plays inline on mobile, no native controls, circular
 *        badge crop. Its background is color-matched to the site's warm ivory
 *        surfaces, and the circular crop keeps it seamless on every canvas.
 * Right: the transparent name-only logo image (asset typography — never
 *        recreated as HTML text).
 *
 * Reduced motion: the video is hidden via `motion-reduce` and the static
 * standalone logo mark takes the exact same grid cell, so the brand stays
 * visible and aligned without JavaScript or layout shift. The video's poster
 * (a still of the animation's first frame) covers playback-unavailable cases.
 *
 * `dark` is accepted for call-site compatibility — both supplied assets are
 * transparent and read correctly on every canvas the design system uses, so
 * it is a deliberate no-op.
