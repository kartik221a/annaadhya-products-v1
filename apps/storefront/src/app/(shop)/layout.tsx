/** Full storefront chrome for every browsing surface (home, shop, product, cart,
 *  account, wishlist, policies…). The checkout flow uses the focused (checkout)
 *  chrome from the approved Stitch design instead.
 *
 *  Navigation links come from the admin Navigation manager (CMS) — but every
 *  category link is validated against the LIVE catalogue before it renders.
 *  Archiving a category therefore removes its navbar/footer links within
 *  seconds, automatically: no one has to revisit the Navigation manager to
 *  clean up. The curated built-in menu only steps in when the manager has
 *  never been configured for a surface (or its signal is unreachable —
 *  fail-open), so the admin's show/hide toggles always win: hiding every
 *  header item hides the menu, it never resurrects the curated defaults. */
